I've witnessed a lot of discussions over my time on Wattpad related to its ranking system; how it works, what factors it depends on or why it appears to make no sense sometimes.

Genuinely, I have no idea, and I don't think anyone has a proper one either. Of course, its fair to make a guess that it would depend on things like votes, comments and views since those are
arguably the most important statistics on the platform, but we can't know how these factors are interpreted to come to a number that determines where your story ranks.

So, I decided to make my own ranking system. And I'll explain every step of the way so you know how I came to this.
