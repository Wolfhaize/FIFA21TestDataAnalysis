# ONC Data

The [Open Novella Contest]('https://www.wattpad.com/user/OpenNovellaContest') (or ONC for short) is an annual writing event. The goal is to write a novella of about 20,000 to 40,000 words using one of the many prompts. The event kicks off every February and runs for about twelve (12) weeks.

### Note
This data was collected from the stories that went through to be longlisted(as on 24/05/2023), thus all stories that got eliminated beforehand have not been considered. his is because I dont think 2k or 8k words is enough to get a proper amount of data on a story. Even more, all stories are marked complete at the moment, and all have been started and marked complete within a similar time frame, which makes data more accurate than sampling random stories from the site.

## What's the point?:
Analyzing the data from ONC stories can help identify trends in the types of stories that are popular or successful in the contest. For example, you might notice that certain genres or themes tend to progress more often, or that stories with certain characteristics (such as shorter or longer lengths) are more successful.

Most people would agree that the best part of ONC is that it brings the community together to do what we all love: reading and writing. In the end however, its still a contest where winners are chosen, and advancement has its benefits. 

## Who worked on this?
Me. Took a while to collect, but hopefully its of use to anyone who cares to look.
